Project Title:
Predicting Carbon Emissions in the Oil and Gas Industry

Problem Statement:
The oil and gas industry is under immense pressure to reduce its carbon footprint. Accurately predicting future carbon emissions is crucial for effective decarbonization strategies. This project aims to develop a model to forecast carbon emissions for major oil and gas companies, considering historical data, industry trends, and relevant external factors.

Main Goal:
To build a predictive model capable of forecasting carbon emissions for oil and gas companies, enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions for decarbonization.

Objective:
To develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts future carbon emissions based on historical data, company-specific factors, and industry trends.
